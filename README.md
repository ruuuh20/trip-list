# TripList

Whether it's the famous museum we have to visit, or the local restaurant that no one knows about that you have to try, we hear about places to that we want to see one day, but often forget or brush by it. This app provides a way to keep track of these places and to keep them organized - like a wishlist. Users can create a "trip" or city, followed by "attractions" in the city, or they can add attractions individually.
